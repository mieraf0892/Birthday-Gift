Carry You Home (feat. Ella Henderson) — Alex Warren

Oh, I hope you know I will carry you home
Whether it's tonight or 55 years down the road
Oh, I know there's so many ways that this could go
Don't want you to wonder, darlin', I need you to know

We were talking to the sunset
Throwing dreams against the wall (ah)
I know none of them have stuck yet
But I bet it on you, honey, oh, I would risk it all

These days, these nights are changin'
My heart, my mind is set on you
I'm not afraid to say it
To say it's true

Oh, I hope you know I will carry you home
Whether it's tonight or 55 years down the road
Oh, I know there's so many ways that this could go
Don't want you to wonder, darlin', I need you to know
In this and every life
I choose us every time

Oh, oh (oh)
Oh, oh (hm, oh)

Back in London, in my hotel room
Yeah, our hometown never felt so far
But I'm in love with everythin' 'bout you
From your big green eyes to your out-of-tune guitar

These days, these nights are changin'
My heart, my mind is set on you
I'm not afraid to say it
To say I do

Oh, I hope you know I will carry you home
Whether it's tonight or 55 years down the road
Oh, I know there's so many ways that this could go
Don't want you to wonder, darlin', I need you to know
In this and every life
I choose us every time

Oh, oh
Oh, oh

Oh, I hope you know I will carry you home
Whether it's tonight or 55 years down the road
