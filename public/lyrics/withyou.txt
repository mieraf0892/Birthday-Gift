With You — Chris Brown

I need you, boo
I gotta see you, boo
And the hearts all over the world tonight
Said the hearts all over the world tonight
I need you, boo (oh)
I gotta see you, boo (hey)
And the hearts all over the world tonight
Said the hearts all over the world tonight

Hey lil' mama, ooh, you're a stunner
Hot little figure, yes, you a winner, and
I'm so glad to be yours
You're a class of your own and
Ooh, little cutie, when you talk to me
I swear the whole world stops
You're my sweetheart and
I'm so glad that you're mine
You are one of a kind, and

You mean to me what I mean to you
And together, baby, there is nothing we won't do
'Cause if I got you, I don't need money, I don't need cars
Girl, you're my all

And oh, I'm into you
And girl, no one else would do
'Cause with every kiss and every hug
You make me fall in love
And now I know I can't be the only one
I bet there's hearts all over the world tonight
With the love of their life who feel
What I feel when I'm with you, with you, with you, with you, with you, girl
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you, oh, girl

I don't want nobody else
Without you there's no one left, and
You're like Jordan's on Saturday
I gotta have you and I cannot wait now
Hey, lil' shorty, say you care for me
You know I care for you, you know that I'll be true
You know that I won't lie, you know that I will try
To be your everything

'Cause if I got you, I don't need money, I don't need cars
Girl, you're my all

And oh, I'm into you (into you)
And girl, no one else would do (won't)
'Cause with every kiss and every hug (hug)
You make me fall in love
And now I know I can't be the only one (I know I can't be the only one)
I bet there's hearts all over the world tonight
With the love of their life who feel
What I feel when I'm with you, with you, with you, with you, with you, oh
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you, yeah

And I will never try to deny that you are my whole life
'Cause if you ever let me go I would die, so I won't front
I don't need another woman, I just need your all or nothing
'Cause if I got that then I'll be straight
Baby, you're the best part of my day

I need you, boo
I gotta see you, boo
And the hearts all over the world tonight
Said the hearts all over the world tonight
They need their boo (they need it)
They gotta see their boo
Said the hearts all over the world tonight
Hearts all over the world tonight

Oh-oh, I'm into you (I'm into you, baby)
And girl, no one else would do
'Cause with every kiss (every kiss) and every hug (every hug)
You make me fall in love (you make me)
And now I know I can't be the only one (can't be the only one)
I bet there's hearts all over the world tonight
With the love of their life who feel
What I feel when I'm with you, with you, with you, with you, with you, girl
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you, oh
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you
Only with you, with you, with you, with you, with you
Babe, yeah
